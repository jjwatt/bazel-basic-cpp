# Basic Bazel C++ Starter repo

I want to keep the main branch at "modern" best practices (as best I
can tell from an outsider's perspective). So, I don't think I want to
include dotfiles like .bazeliskrc or .bazelversion directly or even in
the main branch at all. They're confusing. We want the bare minimum,
and it's already a little confusing to have an empty
WORKSPACE.bazel. There's some other way to redirect, but I'll have to
find it in the manual again. I'll update this once I do.

I'll start with content from the Bazel Tutorial: Build a C++ Project
(https://bazel.build/start/cpp) and probably even split the stages of
that tutorial into branches to keep this main branch/example as simple
as possible.
